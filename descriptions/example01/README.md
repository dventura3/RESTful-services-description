Example 01
==========

In this example I'm considering only one temperature sensor as object available.
This sensor has only one method '@GET /sensor/temperature' that returns the current temperature value measured.

The goal is to obtain the 'sensorID' of a sensor which is able to measure temperature in Celsius degrees.
